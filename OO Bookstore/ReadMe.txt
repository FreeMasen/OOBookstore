In this program we have 2 objects and one structure
The Structure is to capture the author, which has a first name and a last name
One object is a book which has the properties of an author, title, quantity, price and binding
the binding is encapsulated in an enumeration to ensure data fidelity
the second object is a collection of the Book objects called Inventory
This inventory object ensures that only books will be added or removed as well as the logic
for how a book will be found when the user serchs

How to use:
To add a new book fill out the form elements on the left hand side of the screen
It is required that all of the form elements are filled out and have the approprate
data type (this means don't put a number in the author or title fields and the qty and price cannot 
have letters)

To Search the inventory:
Enter your search term and click the search button.
This will return a list of books that match your search in either the Author or Title
to again view the full inventory, perform a search with no infomration in the saerch box. 

To remove one book from qty:
Select the book you would like to remove
click the sell button

To add more of a book we already have in the inventory:
Select the book you would like to add to
enter the number of items that you would like to add
click the add qty button
